# Evernote2OmniFocus

Extended version of the Script by Frank Meeuwsen (www.lifehacking.nl). I changed the script in following aspects:

- todoTag that indicates whether the task needs to get synced is removed for each task after processing it (originally it is removed globaly)
- the reminder of each Evernote note is removed after syncing to OmniFocus, since there is no need to have it in both tools

There are some more things to do but it works well for now...
